## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Malware Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mindtrinket/malwareclassificationdatasetimages/data) from Kaggle. It contains images of malware, categorized into different types, which are used for classification and analysis.

## Data Preparation

### Dataset Structure
Malware images are organized into class-specific folders:
```
/big2015_g/[train|test|val]/[class_name]/
```

### Data Splitting
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Stratified Splitting** is employed to ensure proportional representation of each class.

### Dataset Handling
- **Custom Dataset Class**: Manages the loading, preprocessing, and transforming of images.
- **Transforms**: Includes resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.

---

## Model Definition

### CNN Architecture
- The CNN is designed with:
  - **Convolutional Layers** for feature extraction.
  - **Pooling Layers** for dimensionality reduction.
  - **Fully Connected Layers** for classification.

### Implementation Details
- The model consists of three convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, ReLU activations, dropout, and normalization.
- The model is built using PyTorch and is optimized using the SGD optimizer.

---

## Training

### Training Process
- **Training**: The model is trained by minimizing the loss function.
- **Validation**: Performance is monitored using a validation set after each epoch.
- **Loss Curves**: Visualize the training and validation losses to assess the learning process.

---

## Testing and Evaluation

### Inference
- The trained model predicts labels for the test dataset to assess generalization.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix**: Used to visualize the model's performance across different classes.

## How to Run the Code

**Note**: Since the dataset is on Kaggle, you can add a new notebook to the dataset via this [Malware Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mindtrinket/malwareclassificationdatasetimages/data) link and upload the `mal_class.ipynb` file there to work on it. However, if you prefer to work locally, you can download the data from the link and then follow the instructions below.


1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rusenbb/OmniLearn
   cd Omnilearn
   cd Classification_Malware_Detection_with_CNN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure all dependencies are installed by using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Organize the dataset as described in the *Dataset Structure* section.
   - Adjust paths in the code as necessary to point to the dataset.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open and run the notebook to execute the code:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook mal_class.ipynb
   ```
